Don\u2019t worry if you haven\u2019t given it a name yet, or you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed. Just click the \u201cNew Post\u201d button, and tell us why you\u2019re here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why do this? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Because it gives new readers context. What are you about? Why should they read your blog?<\/li><li>Because it will help you focus your own ideas about your blog and what you\u2019d like to do with it. <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The post can be short or long, a personal intro to your life or a bloggy mission statement, a manifesto for the future or a simple outline of your the types of things you hope to publish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you get started, here are a few questions: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Why are you blogging publicly, rather than keeping a personal journal?<\/li><li>What topics do you think you\u2019ll write about?<\/li><li>Who would you love to connect with via your blog?<\/li><li>If you blog successfully throughout the next year, what would you hope to have accomplished? <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019re not locked into any of this; one of the wonderful things about blogs is how they constantly evolve as we learn, grow, and interact with one another \u2014 but it\u2019s good to know where and why you started, and articulating your goals may just give you a few other post ideas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can\u2019t think how to get started? Just write the first thing that pops into your head. Anne Lamott, author of a book on writing we love, says that you need to give yourself permission to write a \u201ccrappy first draft\u201d. Anne makes a great point \u2014 just start writing, and worry about editing it later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re ready to publish, give your post three to five tags that describe your blog\u2019s focus \u2014 writing, photography, fiction, parenting, food, cars, movies, sports, whatever. These tags will help others who care about your topics find you in the Reader. Make sure one of the tags is \u201czerotohero,\u201d so other new bloggers can find you, too.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is an example post, originally published as part of Blogging University.
